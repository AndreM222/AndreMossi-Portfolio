                        I am currently a University Student at Gannon University
                        studying Computer Science. I was inspired to start this
                        journey since I was in highschool after watching a video
                        regarding programming. At that moment I knew that this
                        was the path which I yearn to walk, no matter what
                        challenges might step in my way.

                    <Paragraph>
                        Besides the homeworks given in class I try to obtain
                        more experiene by doing my own projects. I have taken
                        some online classes which two of them have given me
                        certificates while the others where just practice.
                        Besides classes I tried to adventure myself by making a
                        sorting algorithm for excel files, some websites to
                        improve my abilities not just as back-end but also
                        front-end, etc. I love exploring new languages and
                        taking up new challenges.

                        My main editor is Neovim but I also have experience
                        using Visual Studio, VSCode, and InteliJ. I started
                        using Neovim because I had heard that it was very
                        powerful but too complicated to learn, I am the type of
                        person who enjoys challenges and took on the challenge
                        of learning it. The language I enjoy programming the
                        most is C++ but I am also familiar with other languages
                        and love learning more.
