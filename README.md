<h2>Tools ⚒️</h2>

<h2>Globalization 🌐</h2>

Currently I have the capability of speaking fluently two languages being English and Spanish.
In order to showcase my ability I had decided to add translation option settings.
The website as of now supports the following languages:

- English
- Spanish
- Japanese

I used react internationalization to apply the ability of multiple languages and it gets the translation from json files which I created.

__*I am striving to have native-like fluency in English and Japanese. Feedback is appreciated.*__
